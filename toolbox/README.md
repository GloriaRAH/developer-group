- **Obsidian**: Talked about at length by [Joe](https://github.com/HallJoseph), but it's a neat note taking and organsing piece of software. Link: https://obsidian.md/. Free to use, but has a premium plan allowing cloud back ups. My get around for that is to keep Obsidian in the OneDrive section on my Mac which uses the 2 TB of university provided cloud storage.
